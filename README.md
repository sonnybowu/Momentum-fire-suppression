# Momentum-fire-suppression
Fire suppression optimization for the 2022 Lockheed Martin Momentum challenge

● Created an algorithm that optimized a virtual fire-extinguishing aircraft’s decision and pathfinding functionality to clear out as much fire as possible on a map given fire and water locations with varying fire sizes and limited water carrying capacity.

● Optimized autonomous path-finding and decision-making functionality using both nearest-neighbors and simulated annealing algorithms

● Used technologies and libraries such as Python, GeoJson, and Shapely

● Cleared 95 percent of fire in ten minutes
