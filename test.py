"""
This code simulates and optimizes the flight path of drones for extinguishing wildfires. 
It models the drone's interactions with fires on a landscape, incorporating the need for water replenishment and prioritizing fire suppression based on size and proximity.
The optimization process involves simulated annealing to iteratively improve the drone's tour path, aiming to maximize the total area of fire suppressed within operational constraints such as flight time and water capacity.

Approach:
- The simulation models waypoints as either fires or water sources, using geometric calculations to simulate drone navigation and actions.
- Fires are characterized by their area, and the simulation accounts for the dynamic nature of fires as they are being suppressed.
- A GPS class provides utility functions for calculating distances and identifying nearest or largest fires and water sources.
- The drone's flight path (tour) is initially generated using a nearest-neighbor algorithm, then optimized through simulated annealing to find a more effective sequence of waypoints.
- The flight controller class manages the execution of the optimized tour, simulating real-time control of the drone, including navigation and water deployment.
